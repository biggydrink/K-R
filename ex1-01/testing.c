// sometimes if I make a change and then run this program again,
// it says there's an error - it can't open ex1-1 beause of an
// invalid argument. But i'm not sure why this is happening, unless
// i'm giving it invalid arguments for the printf() function.
// i'm not sure if that makes sense, because it's just printing text
// within quotes, or if it's some sort of eclipse or compiler problem
// that i don't understand yet.
